# Oleksii Kyrychenko

It's my portfolio. I created this mini-app to present you some of my skills in web-developing.

In this application you can navigate by simple navigation menu. It's also support  English, Russian and Ukrainian languages.

This [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application 'read more what is SPA on wikipedia') is created with React and Redux. 
I understand that this web-page could be created in an easier way and using React and Redux is redundant. 
But I want only to show you my own web-developer skills.

Besides, you can find some of my open-source projects, and here is the link.
